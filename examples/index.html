                    This section of the documentation contains a list of links to examples that demonstrate the basic
                    features of the epub.js library. This may be useful for developers who want to use this library in
                    their projects. Most examples present only one feature to make it easier for developers to
                    understand the specifics of the implementation.

                <h2>Layout rendering control</h2>
                <p>Specification section: <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/epub/#flow">Reflowable layouts</a></p>
                <p>Metadata property: <code>rendition:flow</code></p>
                <ol start="1">
                    <li><a href="paginated.html">Paginated</a>
                        <p>Metadata value: <code>paginated</code></p>
                        <p>Display an ebook two pages at a time. Sections of the ebook are displayed separately so if a
                            section has a single page or an odd number of pages it will display with a blank page on the
                            right.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li><a href="paginated-continuous.html">Continuous paginated</a>
                        <p>Metadata value: <code>paginated</code></p>
                        <p>This example is for devices that support the touch events API (see <a
                                href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Touch_events/Using_Touch_Events">Using
                                Touch Events</a>). If
                            the device does not support this API, then the example (1) is used.</p>
                        <p>The fundamental difference from example (1) is that the views container can include many
                            items. This can be represented as a stack of views, in which the previous view, the current
                            view, and the next view are arranged in a sequential chain of views. Only the current view
                            is displayed on the screen; the others are always hidden. However, this rendering method
                            requires more computing resources. To navigate through pages, use swipe touch.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li><a href="scrolled.html">Scrolled</a>
                        <p>Metadata value: <code>scrolled-doc</code></p>
                        <p>In this example, the "flow" option is defined as "scrolled". Each section of the book is
                            displayed within the bounds of the container, with a scrollable hidden area. To navigate
                            between sections, use the left and right arrows, as well as key bindings.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li><a href="scrolled-continuous.html">Continuous scrolling</a>
                        <p>Metadata value: <code>scrolled-continuous</code></p>
                        <p>The view is the same as in example (3). However, the rendering method involves a sequential
                            chain of views that are displayed as the hidden area is scrolled. When the current section
                            ends, the next one is loaded and so on until the last section.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li><a href="scrolled-doc.html">Scrolled Doc</a>
                        <p>Metadata value: <code>scrolled-doc</code></p>
                        <p>Displays each "section" or "chapter" of the ebook in its entirety as a single page of
                            variable height that you can scroll up and down. Includes code to provide left and right
                            navigation links to move to the previous or next section.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li><a href="layout.html">Layout</a>
                        <p>This example combines examples (1,3,5) in one. Basically, this example is needed to test
                            layout features.</p>
                    </li>
                </ol>
                <p class="note">Note: Although the <code>rendition:flow</code> property value is defined as
                    "scrolled-doc" for the
                    (3) and (5) examples, they are different at the layout level.</p>
                <h2>Navigation</h2>
                <ol start="7">
                    <li><a href="toc.html">Table of Contents</a>
                        <p>This example represents table of contents as a drop-down list of sections.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li><a href="locations.html">Locations</a>
                        <p>This example demonstrates how to implement a range based on the content of a book as a
                            percentage. First, the <code>book.locations</code> array is generated. This data is then
                            used to calculate each location's percentage.</p>
                    </li>
                </ol>
                <h2>Annotations</h2>
                <ol start="9">
                    <li><a href="annotations-highlight.html">Highlights</a>
                        <p>Adds the ability to highlight text in the ebook. This version provides no mechanism for
                            saving highlights after the browser is closed. It is an example of capability rather than a
                            working implementation. It works as follows: When a section of text is selected a
                            <code>rendition.on("selected"...)</code> function notes the location of the beginning and
                            ending of the selected text. Two things happen. The code adds a new element to the outer
                            page in a list at the bottom describing the selection and providing a "remove" link.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                </ol>
                <h2>Other means of rendering</h2>
                <ol start="10">
                    <li><a href="contents.html">Contents</a>
                        <p>This example demonstrates the <code>innerText</code> rendering from range, which was obtained
                            from EpubCFI format string.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li><a href="renderless.html">Renderless</a>
                        <p>The name for this example is misleading since the book certainly does render. What's unique
                            in this example is that the book's table of contents is read in and a list of sections in
                            developed, then each section is rendered as it is called for by a
                            <code>section.render()</code> call, but there's no master <code>book.renderTo()</code> call.
                            Functionlly this seems exactly the same as (3) example.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                </ol>
                <h2>Other examples</h2>
                <ol start="12">
                    <li><a href="archived.html">Archived</a>
                        <p>Display ebook from an XXXX.epub file rather than an unzipped folder. This may be
                            substantially slower for large ebooks.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li><a href="input.html">Open from File</a>
                        <p>Allows you to select an epub file from your local computer that gets rendered in the browser.
                        </p>

                    <li><a href="hooks.html">Hooks</a>
                        <p>This example shows how to insert external javascript and external css files into a book after
                            the
                            book has been loaded into memory. This might, for example, allow you to override internal
                            css
                            from the ebook to change fonts and text-size by either replacing a css file from the ebook
                            or
                            calling a javascript that gets added to the inside of the ebook such as adding jQuery inside
                            the
                            ebook. For example: this could be used to have + and - buttons that increase or decrease the
                            font-size in the ebook. When the + or - button is pressed it could call to insert and
                            execute a
                            script to replace the font-size of paragraph elements with one slightly larger or smaller.
                            This
                            example doesn't actually implement any such thing, it just shows how to insert the code, or
                            insert a css file.</p>
                        <p>You can't just run a script on the outer page to change things inside the rendered ebook
                            because
                            the ebook is rendered inside an iframe. This mechanism lets you inject things into the
                            iframe
                            and run them after the book is rendered.</p>
